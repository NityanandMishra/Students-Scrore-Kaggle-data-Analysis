## Introduction
This notebook aims to provide insights into a dataset through a series of steps including data loading, cleaning, and visualization. It uses `pandas` for data manipulation and `seaborn` for creating visualizations.

## Setup
To run this notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Data Loading
The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file. Ensure that the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook or provide the correct path.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
```

## Data Cleaning
Basic data cleaning steps are performed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types.

```python
# Example of data cleaning
df.dropna(inplace=True)
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].astype('desired_type')
```

## Data Exploration
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. This includes generating summary statistics and visualizing the data.

```python
# Display summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Visualize the distribution of a column
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(df['column_name'])
plt.show()
```

## Visualization
The notebook contains various visualizations to help understand the data better. For example, count plots for categorical variables and scatter plots for numerical variables.

```python
# Count plot example
ax = sns.countplot(data=df, x='EthnicGroup')
ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0])
```
